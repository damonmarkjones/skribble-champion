# Skribble Champion

Who's going to be the 2023 Skribble Champion?

## Updating Scores

Really noddy build this in like 10 mins so don't judge

- Update the `data/player-scores.ts` file to reflect the games `played` and `wins` for each player
- Commit message should include the date the game was played i.e `update scores for 6th Jan`
